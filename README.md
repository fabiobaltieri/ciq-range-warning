# Range Warning

A Connect IQ DataField to notify when you get too far from the start.

Default distance is 2000m and can be changed on the datafield settings. The
data field displays the distance left form the start, when the range goes under
50 meters it notifies the user by beeping and vibrating up to 5 times every
second.

It also records the range in a separate Fit field that shows up on Garmin
Connect.
